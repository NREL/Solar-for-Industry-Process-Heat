#### Sector Composition
>"..six main industrial sub-sectors: food, paper, chemicals, nonmetallic mineral products, primary metals, and transportation equipment. Two additional smaller demands are represented: other manufacturing, including wood and plastics, and non-manufacturing, including agriculture and construction.  These demands make up about 32.5% of the total energy used in the demand sectors of the database. The six main industrial subsectors account for 60% of energy demand in the industrial sector.  Another 10% is covered by the other manufacturing and non-manufacturing demands.  Much of the remaining 30%, which includes petroleum and coal products, is covered in other parts of the database including the refinery sector and the various resource supply sectors."

#### Reference Data
>"National demands are calculated for each sub-sector using AEO reference case data for the value of shipments in dollars and the total energy consumption per dollar shipment.  The energy consumption per dollar shipment is held constant at the 2009 value for all years. National level demands are then regionalized using EIA Manufacturing Energy Consumption Survey (MECS) (EIA, 2006) data for fuel consumption by sub-sector by region. With these data, the percent of each sub-sector demand met by each Region in 2006 was calculated. These percentages were then applied to the total sub-sector demand at a national level to obtain regional demands. The sub-sector breakdowns by region in 2006 are assumed to remain consistent throughout the model time horizon. "

#### Technology Composition/Choice
>"The industrial sector is modeled a little differently than the other end-use sectors. The industrial sector has a three layer structure consisting of a demand layer, an end-use demand technology layer, and a process technology layer."

#### Efficiency Assumptions
>"Energy efficiency improvements, which cause the AEO reference case values for energy consumption per dollar shipment to decrease over time, are ignored in the demand calculations.  Instead, energy efficiency improvements are handled in the process technologies used to meet the demands."
