def bisection(f,a,b,N):
    '''Approximate solution of f(x)=0 on interval [a,b] by bisection method.

    Parameters
    ----------
    f : function
        The function for which we are trying to approximate a solution f(x)=0.
    a,b : numbers
        The interval in which to search for a solution. The function returns
        None if f(a)*f(b) >= 0 since a solution is not guaranteed.
    N : (positive) integer
        The number of iterations to implement.

    Returns
    -------
    x_N : number
        The midpoint of the Nth interval computed by the bisection method. The
        initial interval [a_0,b_0] is given by [a,b]. If f(m_n) == 0 for some
        midpoint m_n = (a_n + b_n)/2, then the function returns this solution.
        If all signs of values f(a_n), f(b_n) and f(m_n) are the same at any
        iteration, the bisection method fails and return None.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> f = lambda x: x**2 - x - 1
    >>> bisection(f,1,2,25)
    1.618033990263939
    >>> f = lambda x: (2*x - 1)*(x - 3)
    >>> bisection(f,0,1,10)
    0.5
