# Use a process parity class, which is instantiated with data on a specific
# combustion system(?). Process parity for a solar technology system is then
# solved based on this info.
# Sensitivity analysis through Monte Carlo runs will be used only once?

# Need methods for: solving process parity (numpy.linalg.solve; would need to
# set up LCOH equations as linear matrix equation),
# doing Monte Carlo runs (https://people.duke.edu/~ccc14/sta-663/MonteCarlo.html),
# calculating different results (IRR, payback, etc.)
