## Basic Guide to Directories
* [/county_heat_calculations/](https://github.com/NREL/Solar-for-Industry-Process-Heat/tree/master/county_heat_calculations): Contains code for calculating the county level process heat estimates for 2014, available on the [NREL Data Catalog](https://dx.doi.org/10.7799/1570008). 
* [/heat_load_calculations/](https://github.com/NREL/Solar-for-Industry-Process-Heat/tree/master/heat_load_calculations): Contains code for estimating the hourly load profiles of boiler and process heat demand, which is used in the technical opportunities analysis. Representative load shapes were uploaded to the [NREL Data Catalog](https://dx.doi.org/10.7799/1570008). A general overview of the load shape estimation approach is provided by the subdirectory's readme. 
* [/tech_opportunity_analysis/](https://github.com/NREL/Solar-for-Industry-Process-Heat/tree/master/tech_opportunity_analysis): Code for estimating county technical opportunity for each solar technology package. A brief summary of the important code files is provided by the subdirectory's readme.
* [/process_parity_calc/](https://github.com/NREL/Solar-for-Industry-Process-Heat/tree/master/process_parity_calc): Code for calculating process parity, including LCOH calculations. An overview of the approach and code is provided by the subdirectory's readme.
* [/CHP/](https://github.com/NREL/Solar-for-Industry-Process-Heat/tree/master/CHP): Contains code for analyzing the [CHP Installation Database](https://doe.icfwebservices.com/chpdb/) at the county level.
* [/Results analysis/](https://github.com/NREL/Solar-for-Industry-Process-Heat/tree/master/Results%20analysis/mapping): Contains code for analyzing results, including geographic analysis.
